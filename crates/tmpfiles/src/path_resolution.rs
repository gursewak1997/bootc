/// it happens to be a symlink itself: it's the thing being declared by the

/// targets (chroot-style reinterpreted against the rootfs, e.g. a top-level
/// `/home -> /var/home`), and symlink loops (surfaced as a standard `ELOOP`
/// I/O error), without this crate needing to reimplement any of that itself.

/// Since the kernel has already done the real work of resolving the parent
/// down to a live, open file descriptor, the result is reported as that

/// directly on an already-open fd is kernel-authoritative and immune to
/// concurrent path mutations (renames of ancestors, etc.).
